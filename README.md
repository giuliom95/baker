# Normal maps baker

![Explanatory image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giuliom95/baker/master/media/images/bunnies.jpg)

C++ and Embree implementation of a normal map baker. It is still in an early development stage but it works for most of the cases. The only dependencies are OpenEXR(http://www.openexr.com/) and Embree(http://embree.github.io).
Compilation under a CentOS7 machine should be straightforward. Not tested on other systems.

### TODO
* Multi-threading
* Better usability
* Maya plugin
